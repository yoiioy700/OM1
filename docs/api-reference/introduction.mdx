description: "Welcome to the OpenMind API Reference"
---

OpenMind integrates with multiple LLM providers to offer a diverse range of features. This API reference provides details on endpoints, parameters, and responses, enabling efficient interaction with the OpenMind API.

## API Keys

OpenMind requires an API key to authenticate requests. You can obtain an API key by signing up for an account on the [OpenMind portal](https://portal.openmind.org). The API key must be included in the `Authorization` or `x-api-key` header of each request, used to authenticate your requests and track usage quotas.

**Keep your API key confidential**. Never share it with others or expose it in client-side code, such as in browsers or apps.

Remember to include your API key in the `Authorization` or `x-api-key` header of each request. For example:

```bash
x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY
# or,
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

For websocket connections, include the API key in the query string. For example: `wss://api.openmind.org?api_key=<YOUR_API_KEY>`.
