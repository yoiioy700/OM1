The Developer Cookbook is a collection of practical, high-impact recipes designed to help you extend, customize, and build on top of the OpenMind platform.
If the Quickstart shows you how to use OM1, this Cookbook shows you how to build with it.

Here's what you can do with OM1
1. Build a new config file
2. Introduce a new mode
3. Configure a new input Plugin

## Getting Started with Development

Before building with OM1, make sure you've completed the [Getting Started](../developing/1_get-started) guide and have OM1 installed.

Then dive into any recipe that interests you!

## Development workflow

### Linting and Testing (Mandatory)

To check/format/lint your code before committing, install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) and execute `pre-commit install`. This ensures that pre-commit checks run before each commit.

Additionally, you can manually trigger all checks by running

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Updating the Docs

After you have updated the core documentation, make sure to run:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/mintlify.sh # first time only
./scripts/mintlify.sh
```

to also update secondary documentation systems like mintlify.

### Unit Testing

To unit test the system, run:
```bash
uv run pytest --log-cli-level=DEBUG -s
```

Use type `hints` and `docstrings` for better code maintainability.
